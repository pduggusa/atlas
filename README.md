# Overview
Atlas is a conceptual structure visualization and annotation platform featuring a modular interactive renderer that allows the user to create or calculate multiple structured or unstructured views of their data (represented as "Elements" in the object model). These views can be shared with others, and the same data may be represented in different views while maintaining consistency.

The front-end is paired with a simple, flexible and scalable multi-user key/value store for user annotation of the data, along with subsequent reporting.

The same data set can be leveraged in multiple structures, leaving the user free to create multiple structures of the same library. The links between each element in the renderer can carry its own attributes, allowing for dynamic re-representation, aggregation, and summarization of data based on the rendered view.  This allows visual and quantitative comparison based on the relationships defined by the user in the renderer.

# Use Cases
* **Strategy teams** can collaborate to quickly generate, iterate, assess, and compare business plan and proposal assets.
* **Analysts** can construct reports across structures for comparative and historical analysis.
* **Generative AI Consumers** can structure GenAI output for human curation, research, and annotation
* **Instructors** can distribute syllabus and other assets, and gather assets from **learners**, who can leverage it for structured notetaking aligning to a syllabus or learning plan, or independent learning
* **Content Managers** can construct multiple views and hierarchies of content to provide persona-aligned navigation experiences
* **Buy-side planners** can collect and report on assets from vendors, suppliers and distributors.
* **UX designers** can quickly re-imagine legacy records and navigation experiences, using the Atlas backend to combine and enrich data from multiple sources.
* **Consultants** can create flexible, semi-structured data sets and no-code UIs for comparative analysis.

## User Types
* **Structure Owner**: Add Collaborators, Structure and Structure Link CRUD, Export Structure
* **Structure Editor**: Edit Structure Map and Records
* **Structure Commenter**:  Browse and comment on structure map and records
* **Structure Viewer**: Browse structure map and records
* **Instance Admininstrator**:  Instance CRUD, Structure Owner CRUD 

# Architecture

![](./img/arch.svg)

## Object Model
Each `Structure User` can create, read, update, delete, and share `Structures`, which represent an idea acted on by an individual or group of people.  In an educational setting, this could be a class syllabus or group project, in an academic setting this might represent a field of research or domain specialty, in a corporate setting it could represent a business proposal.

Structures are comprised of `Elements`.  Each Element is associated with a single uniquely identitified `Record`.  Each Record can contain data of any type as defined by the Structure Owners.  Additionally, the Structure Owner can define an `Element Type`, which can be used to associated a library of record formats to element types.

Elements are represented on one or more `Structure Maps`, which are graphical representations of the elements on an infinite scroll 2D canvas.  Elements may be connected to other Elements in the Structure Map via zero or more `Element Links`, which are also associated with a single uniquely identified Record, the attributes of which are separately defined by the Structure Owner.  Structure Maps may also be linked to Elements residing in external Structures via `Structure Links`.
