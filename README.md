# Overview
Atlas is a prototype multi-user structure visualization and annotation platform hosted at [dev.atlasflow.co](https://dev.atlasflow.co), featuring a modular interactive renderer that allows the user to create or calculate multiple structured or unstructured views of a shared dataset (represented as "Elements" and "Records" in the object model). These views can be shared with others, and the same data may be represented in different views while maintaining consistency.
