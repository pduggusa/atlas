Data structures and objects for automated testing

- `Element` contains structures that stress the depth (10 deep) and width (~400 elements) of a structure.  Additionally a CSV provides more example structures for testing
- `Record` contains example markdown documents with linked binaries in the `blob` directory.  record02.md contains poorly formatted markdown and unusual characters.
